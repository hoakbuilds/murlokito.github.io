# This is my hydeout

Hello everyone, 

After quite sometime in the reds and feeling like I would never have the time I'd need to iron out the kinks on my website and it's adjacent blog, I feel like I finally got there and managed to get everything to work the way I wanted it to.

I'm Hugo, an undefined reference to 'functionDeveloper', born and raised in Portugal. Always dreamed of making it big at something. Just don't know what or when.
Very fond of video games and electronic music. 
Bitcoin, Lightning Network, Golang. Distributed systems, cryptography, data science.
