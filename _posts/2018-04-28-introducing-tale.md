# This is my hydeout

Hello everyone, 

After quite sometime in the reds and feeling like I would never have the time I'd need to iron out the kinks on my website and it's adjacent blog, I feel like I finally got there and managed to get everything to work the way I wanted it to.


## About the blog

Regarding the blog, I'm sure you'll have answers, the blog page is based on hydeout by Andrew Fong, which you can find the source code and more info about [here](https://github.com//chesterhow/tale).
I'm not sure at which stage you will find this page and all, but this is a work in progress that I will be editing and pushing forward on a have-time-to-spend-so-spend-it basis, it was my way of trying to achieve a point of constant learning in one of today's fastest growing and evolving industries and which I've found myself to become increasingly fond of.

In this place I will be sharing everything I want to share, from music to music and video production, from coding lessons and tips and tricks (of both imperative and functional programming languages, both things I learned in the past and things I learn as I go by), to perhaps cooking tips and recipes or even me trying to chart cryptoassets as well as trying to present a (mostly) unbiased view from the standpoint of an investor trying to look at the emerging markets.

For this, the first thing I'll share is actually going to be one of my favorite companies to actually isolate myself from the world surrounding me when I try to code, behold, the almighty Boris Brejcha at the Ch√¢teau de Fontainebleau, for the epic Cercle.
