Hi, I'm Hugo, a 25 year old Software Engineer born and raised in Portugal.

I've been very interest in cryptocurrencies and trading for a few years, my projects and what I'll blog about here are a testament to that.

I've specialised in backend development and systems design over the years and I'll attempt to share some of that knowledge through this blog.
